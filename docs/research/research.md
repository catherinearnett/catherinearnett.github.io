## Verbal Reduplication in Mandarin
I am investigating the properties of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese, and I am especially interested in the conceptual and semantic effects of verbal reduplication. 

For a brief overview, you can check out my [AMLaP](https://osf.io/y83c6/) and [NACCL-32](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lzP9tlZ54oGApyQEBIUxcP1svdDr7uUNcg7_qlcfRnA/edit) presentations. For more information, see the [Reduplication](https://catherinearnett.github.io/docs/research/reduplication/) page.

## Language and Environment

My collaborator, [Maho Takahashi](https://matakahas.github.io/), and I are working on a reanalysis of the work on the relationship between language and the environment in which a language is spoken. 

We have a poster, entitled [_Creating a Baseline to Evaluate Correlations Between
Language and Environment_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k5Qi1377JDDmC9g53YbXD3TEj-DZnV94/view?usp=sharing) [[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o1F6IQKiuEkR8uZ7ZeUyurbWZAILl1pL/view?usp=sharing)] at the [Machine Learning for Language Evolution Workshop](https://ml4evolang.github.io/) at the [Joint Conference on Language Evolution 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/joint-conf-language-evolution).

## Previous Work

During my undergraduate degree, I was working on the typology of the framing of events in Romance languages. I used several corpora and looked at the change of verb framing from Latin through Medieval French and Spanish to modern Romance varieties. 

To learn more, you can read my [proceedings paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341495811_Pathways_of_Change_in_Romance_Motion_Events_A_Corpus-Based_Comparison).
