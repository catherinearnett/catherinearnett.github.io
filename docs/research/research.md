## Multilingual Language Models
My dissertation work focuses on multilingual language models. Some of the questions I am interested include:

* How do multilingual language models represent information for the different languages they were trained on?
* What are the optimal conditions for crosslingual transfer in multilingual models?
* How can we improve performance for low-resource languages?  

One of my projects uses Structural Priming, an experimental paradigm from psycholinguistics to find evidence for multilingual abstract grammatical representations in multilingual language models. My collaborators ([James Michaelov](https://jmichaelov.com/about/), [Tyler Chang](https://tylerachang.github.io/), and [Benjamin Bergen](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~bkbergen/)) and I presented the full paper "[Structural Priming Demonstrates Abstract Grammatical Representations in Multilingual Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.227/)" at EMNLP 2023. We also presented an extended abstract "[Crosslingual Structural Priming and the Pre-Training Dynamics of Bilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07929)" at the Multilingual Representations Learning Workshop co-located with EMNLP 2023. 

Another project I have been working on involves transfer and low-resource languages. My collaborator [Tyler Chang](https://tylerachang.github.io/) and I trained 10,000 language models on 252 languages to investigate the condition for optimal crosslingual transfer, especially for low-resource languages. We have a manuscript pre-print entitled, ["When Is Multilinguality a Curse? Language Modeling for 250 High- and Low-Resource Languages"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09205). 

## Verbal Reduplication in Mandarin
I am interested in the various verbal reduplication patterns in Mandarin Chinese, especially their usage and meaning. 

For a brief overview, you can check out my [AMLaP](https://osf.io/y83c6/) and [NACCL-32](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lzP9tlZ54oGApyQEBIUxcP1svdDr7uUNcg7_qlcfRnA/edit) presentations. For more information, see the [Reduplication](https://catherinearnett.github.io/docs/research/reduplication/) page.


## Language and Environment

My collaborator, [Maho Takahashi](https://matakahas.github.io/), and conducted a reanalysis of the work on the relationship between language and the environment in which a language is spoken. We found that the correlations are not robust when other factors are taken into consideration.

We have a poster, entitled [_Creating a Baseline to Evaluate Correlations Between
Language and Environment_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k5Qi1377JDDmC9g53YbXD3TEj-DZnV94/view?usp=sharing) [[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o1F6IQKiuEkR8uZ7ZeUyurbWZAILl1pL/view?usp=sharing)] at the [Machine Learning for Language Evolution Workshop](https://ml4evolang.github.io/) at the [Joint Conference on Language Evolution 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/joint-conf-language-evolution).

## Previous Work

During my undergraduate degree, I was working on the typology of the framing of events in Romance languages. I used several corpora and looked at the change of verb framing from Latin through Medieval French and Spanish to modern Romance varieties. 

To learn more, you can read my [proceedings paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341495811_Pathways_of_Change_in_Romance_Motion_Events_A_Corpus-Based_Comparison).
