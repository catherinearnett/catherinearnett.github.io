## Verbal Reduplication in Mandarin
I am investigating the properties of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese, and I am especially interested in the conceptual and semantic effects of verbal reduplication. 

If you want to learn more about this project, check out my [AMLaP]{https://osf.io/y83c6/} and 
and [NACCL-32]{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lzP9tlZ54oGApyQEBIUxcP1svdDr7uUNcg7_qlcfRnA/edit} presentations. 


## Previous Work

During my undergraduate degree, I was working on the typology of the framing of events in Romance languages. I used several corpora and looked at the change of verb framing from Latin through Medieval French and Spanish to modern Romance varieties.
