## LIGN 170: Psycholinguistics 

In summer 2023, I taught Pyscholinguistics at UC San Diego. For information on my course, see my course page: [LIGN 170 Page](https://catherinearnett.github.io/170).

If you are planning to teach a psycholinguistics class, I'm happy to share assessment materials for the course.
