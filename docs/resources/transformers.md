# Transformers

This is a handout I developed for a presentation about Transformers, where I hoped to demonstrate the connection between the conceptual elements of the model architecture and the fundamental mathematical operations behind it. This handout was developed in reference to the [minGPT model repo](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT/blob/master/mingpt/model.py) and the [Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). 

This graphic was made using tikz in LaTeX.
