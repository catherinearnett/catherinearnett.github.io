## The Quest for the Best *Best Western* in the West

If you grew up in the US, you might have had family road trips where you spent the night at a bottom tier motel or hotel. The kind where you get a free continental breakfast in the morning that is so far from anything relating to Continental Europe you won't realize until you're 23 that that's even what 'continental' in continental breakfast refers to. The highlight of the 'continental' breakfast, of course, is the waffle machine.

Best Western, for me, is the epitome of this kind of hotel. Even though staying at a Best Western (BW) isn't mind blowing, it is deeply tied with the nostalgia of the family trips of your youth.

Now that I'm an adult (but one on a serious budget), if I splurge for a hotel instead of camping or staying with friends, I always choose Best Western. And since I'm living in California now and travelling the Western United States for the first time in my life, I got to wondering. What is the best Western *Best Western*?

My curiosity is obviously not at all driven by how funny that question sounds, of course.

I scraped the Best Western website for all locations in the Western states, which I have defined as Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Across these states, there are 385 Best Western and Best Western Plus Locations.

Here's a pretty map of all the locations (color coded for Best Westerns (blue) and Best Western Pluses (red)):
