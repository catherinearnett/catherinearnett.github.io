# Food Classification

Here I will outline my manifesto and theoretical approach to food classification. I provide background on food classification more broadly as well as the specific question of whether all foods can be categorized as soups, salads, or sandwiches. I propose an alternative to the three-way classification, using theoretical, experimental, and computation methods.
