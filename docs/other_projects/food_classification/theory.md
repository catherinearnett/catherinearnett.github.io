# A New Theory of Food Classification

Here propose an all-encompassing taxonomy of foods. I will work through each part of the taxonomy and provide examples for many apparent edge cases.

A note on formalisms. Capitalized terms are final categories. Lowercase terms are super-categories and may also be used in specific food terms.

## Just Food

The first important point to establish is that the proposed taxonomy of food only encompasses edible things, to which I assign a [+edible] feature. So, in the following tweet, items in the "preparation rebel" row would not be classifiable in this taxonomy.

Similarly, a sandwich composed of two pieces of bread with Earth in the middle (Fig. 2), would not be considered under this taxonomy because not all ingredients are edible.

## meat vs. salad

Another core distinction to make is the difference between meat and salad. meats are foods that are composed of a single atomic substance. This category can be further subdivided into Meat and Bread based on the number of ingredients (see below). meat as a category encompasses any food substance that cannot be further broken down or separated. This includes:

* steak, carrot, tofu, milk
* smoothies, bisques, ice cream

### Meat vs. Bread

* steak with butter

## Everything is salad
