## What is Food Classification?

Food classification is the quest to create a concise taxonomy of foods. A taxonomy is a classification, especially a hierarchical classification of things into different types or groups. In this case, the goal is to classify foods into categories. 

There are a variety of classifications of foods into three categories: soup, salad, sandwich (and sometimes meat). 

We have many ways that we already classify foods, such as plant-based, raw, 'healthy', keto, dessert, savory, etc. One way that ingredients have historically been classified is according to the food pyramid. There are some notable controversial examples within the food pyramid, namely with the fruit-vegetable distinction. One of the most famous examples of this controversial distinction is the tomato. Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?

Tomatoes are botanically fruits, but as the addage goes "“Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad.” (Brian O’Driscoll, 2009). While *technically* tomatoes are a fruit, culinarily we do not consider them to be fruits.
