## What is Food Classification?

Food classification is the quest to create a concise taxonomy of foods. A taxonomy is a classification, especially a hierarchical classification of things into different types or groups. In this case, the goal is to classify foods into categories. 

There are a variety of classifications of foods into three categories: soup, salad, sandwich (and sometimes meat). 

We have many ways that we already classify foods, such as plant-based, raw, 'healthy', keto, dessert, savory, etc. One way that ingredients have historically been classified is according to the food pyramid. There are some notable controversial examples within the food pyramid, namely with the fruit-vegetable distinction. One of the most famous examples of this controversial distinction is the tomato. Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?

Tomatoes are botanically fruits, but as the addage goes "Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad." (Brian Oâ€™Driscoll, 2009). While *technically* tomatoes are a fruit, culinarily we do not consider them to be fruits.

Another similar question is the status of corn. Is it a fruit, a vegetable, or a cereal? The maize plant is a grass, which would make its fruit a cereal, like wheat. However, botanically it is a fruit because it develops from the flower of the plant and contains seeds. But corn could also be classified as a vegetable. According to the USDA, if corn is harvested when it is fully matured and then dried, it is considered a grain (or cereal) and can be milled. Fresh corn is harvested when the kernels are still full of liquid. When it is harvested at this stage, it is considered a starchy vegetable ([USDA](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Is-corn-a-grain-or-a-vegetable)).

An important takeaway here is that it is important to specify the criteria used to classify something. A tomato, for example, is classified differently depending on whether you use botanical or culinary criteria. 

The difference between this kind of classification and the soup-salad-sandwich type classification is that the food pyramid mostly categorizes ingredients, whereas food classification is able to classify complex dishes. 

## Why should you care?

### Food Universals

One of the most interesting insights that food classification gives us is that around the world people have created foods that are fundamentally very similar. For example, in many places around the world, people eat something that is essentially fried bread or a dumpling. Food classification offers the opportunity to find the core similarities of foods around the world. The fact that many different cultures have a food that is dumpling-like has already been pointed out:

</p>

But I have also found many examples of cultures that have some kind of fried bread. Here I make the distinction between filled breads (which are basically dumplings) and unfilled breads.

### Food Wars

Another reason that this debate gets so heated and people get so invested is because people have really strong opinions about food. I couldn't possibly make a comprehensive list of food debates that have taken over the internet at some point even just within the last decade, but some notable food debates include:

- Some version of which goes in the vessel first:
  -  Do you put the cereal or the milk in the bowl first?
  - Do you put the cream or the jam on a scone first?
  - Do you put tea or milk in the mug first?
- How do you eat X?
  - Eat a KitKat by bar or bite into it?
  - Eat pizza with hands or fork and knife?
  - Fold pizza slide or not?
  - Do you cut your sandwich vertically, diagonally, into squares, etc.?
  - Do you eat the Oreo whole or lick the cream off first or dunk it in milk, etc.?
  - Do you like the crust/edge piece or the middle piece (e.g. of a brownie)?
  - Do you eat macaroni and cheese with a spoon or a fork?
- What is the best X?
  - What is the best chicken sandwich?
  - Deep dish or thin crust pizza?
  - What is the best style of french fry?
  - What is the best regional burger chain in the US?
  - Coke vs. Pepsi?
- Food combinations
  - Is it acceptable to put pineapple on pizza?
- Names for foods
  - pop vs. soda vs. coke
  - hero vs. sub vs. hoagie
  - are noodles and pasta the same thing?

These debates relate to cultural, linguistic, culinary differences. For example, the difference between pasta and noodles is cultural. Some noodles and some types of pasta may be indistinguishable from each other in terms of ingredients, but pasta originated in present-day Italy and noodles originated in present-day China. These foods are associated with two different cultures - both with strong cultural identities. There is also a culinary aspect, since you probably wouldn't put soy sauce on pasta or alfredo sauce on rice noodles. **CITATIONS**

With respect to the order of toppings on a scone, while you could argue there are practical differences between putting the cream or the jam on your scone first, if you're from Devon, you probably put the cream on first, and if you're from Cornwall, you probably put the jam on first <a href="https://wiselivingmagazine.co.uk/food-and-drink/inspiration/cream-tea-wars-is-it-cream-or-jam-first/">(Source).</a>
