# About

I'm Catherine. I'm currently a PhD Candidate in [Linguistics at the University of California at San Diego](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/) with a specialization in [Computational Social Science](https://css.ucsd.edu/). I'm interested in psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics, and Natural Language Processing.

My dissertation aims to describe the form-meaning correspondence in Mandarin Chinese predicate reduplication. My research combines linguistic theory with tools from psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics, and NLP. 

I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Edinburgh in Chinese and Linguistics (MAHons), including one year at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China.
