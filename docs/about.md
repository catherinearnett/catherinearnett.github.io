# About

I'm Catherine. I'm currently a grad student in [Linguistics at the University of California at San Diego](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/). I'm interested in the syntax-semantics interface, psycholinguistics, dialectal variation, language variation and change, and corpus linguistic, among other things.

I am currently looking at verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. I am interested in event construal when there is verbal reduplication: how long people perceive events to be, how many subevents listeners imagine, if there are any Manner changes, etc. 

I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Edinburgh in Chinese and Linguistics (MAHons), including one year at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China.
