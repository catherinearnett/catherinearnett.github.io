| Fixed segment notes   | If the reduplicant has (a) fixed segment(s), record the segment, its location, and any conditions on its presence (e.g. [i], affix-final, occurs when the initial segment of the base is a consonant)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Copy site             | What part of the word is copied? Fill in with the edge and the number of units (e.g. leftmost 2 syllables of the base). If the copy does not begin at an edge, record the nearest edge as well as the number of units copied, and the number of units intervening between the copied portion of the word and the nearest edge (e.g. 2 moras preceding the rightmost mora of the base)                                                                                                                                          |
| Attachment site       | Where does the reduplicant attach to the base? Fill in with one or more of the following: prefix, suffix, infix, indeterminate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Attachment site notes | If the reduplicant is an infix, record exactly where it infixes (e.g. between the first and second syllables). Record whether the relevant unit for describing the location of infixing is the same as the relevant unit for describing the size of the reduplicant by filling in ‘unit = same’ or ‘unit = different’. If reduplicants have more than one attachment site, record the conditions for each (e.g. infix if the initial segment of the base is a consonant, prefix if the initial segment of the base is a vowel) |
| Attachment adjacency  | Is the place where the reduplicant attaches to the base adjacent to the part of the word that was copied? Fill in ‘yes’ or ‘no’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Underapplication      | Are there phonological processes that apply in the language in general but do not apply in the reduplication context? Fill in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ followed by the name of the process if applicable.

Fill in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ followed by a description of the change if applicable (e.g. yes, final consonant is deleted)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Multiple copies       | Are multiple copies allowed? (How) does this affect the meaning? Fill in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ followed by the number of copies, and a description of the effect on the meaning if applicable (e.g. yes, 2 copies, durative meaning). Count the number of copies according to the following system: the form mumu-muto has two copies. The form mu-muto has one copy.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Multiple patterns     | Can a single word undergo multiple reduplication patterns? Fill in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ followed by a description of the patterns and any restrictions.

| Syntactic category    | If reduplication only applies to roots from (a) specific syntactic category/ies (e.g. verbs), list the category/ies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Meaning               | State the meaning marked by the reduplication pattern. If a single reduplication pattern can mark more than one meaning, list all of the meanings. If a single meaning can be marked by more than one reduplication pattern, make a separate entry for each pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
