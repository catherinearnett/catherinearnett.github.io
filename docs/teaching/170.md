## About the Course

This course introduces students to psycholinguistics. We will discuss fundamental theories, explore common experimental methodologies, and engage with the literature. Students will be introduced to different
theories through lectures, in-class activities, independent readings, and written assignments.

This course meets twice a week for 2h50. 

### Learning Outcomes

Course Learning Outcomes
1. Describe fundamental models of language comprehension and productions
    * List processes involved in speech perception, word recognition, sentence processing, text processing, reading and language acquisition
2. Identify common psycholinguistics experimental paradigms, such as behavioral tasks (e.g. acceptability judgements, priming), self-paced reading, and eye tracking.
3. For a psycholinguistics article,
   * Identify research questions;
   *  Explain elements of experimental design using key terminology;
   *  Critically assess results and conclusions in a psycholinguistics journal article
   *  Even if the student does not understand every term or every part of the paper, extract the key components of a paper: research question, hypothesis, experimental logic, methods, results, conclusions.
4. Critique a psycholinguistics article, evaluate its methodology and conclusions, and formulate an idea for a follow-up experiment to address issues identified
5. Gain confidence in engaging with primary literature in psycholinguistics
6. Demonstrate knowledge of course material through written assessment, applying the writing tips introduced in class to improve clarity
