To contact me, you can email me at ccarnett [at] ucsd [dot] edu or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linguist_cat). You can find my work on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine-Arnett), [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0448-5415), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bLS_8RAAAAAJ&hl=en).
