# Welcome

My name is [Catherine Arnett](https://catherinearnett.github.io/about) and this is my website and portfolio. 

I am a PhD Student in the [Linguistics Department at the University of California, San Diego](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/). 

This website hosts information about [me](https://catherinearnett.github.io/about), my research on [Mandarin Reduplication](https://catherinearnett.github.io/research) and computational typology, my [non-linguistics projects](https://catherinearnett.github.io/other). I hope to also provide some resources for other linguists and researchers.


To contact me, you can email me at ccarnett [at] ucsd [dot] edu or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linguist_cat). You can find my work on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine-Arnett), [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0448-5415), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bLS_8RAAAAAJ&hl=en). I theoretically post my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/catherinearnett).
